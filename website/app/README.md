# TikTokBikBok Backend
Backend for hosting the matching program. Uses a React frontend and a Python Flask backend.

To start the Flask server locally do as follows.

In the second terminal tab, cd into flask-api. 
Run the following commands to prep Flask:
`python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once this is done, navigate to the localhost link it provides and you should see the frontend served by Flask.
